#+TITLE: TODOs

* TODO jump
    configurable
* TODO crouch
    with reducing dx
* TODO camera
    Background must be a little bigger than window size.
    Background is kind of camera subobject.
* TODO background
** DONE simple stupid background
** TODO infinite scrolling
** TODO several layers that move with different speed
* TODO Shooting
    Configurable place for spawning charges.
    Charge is separate class hierarchy subclasses =game-object=.
    Also weapon is separate hierarchy too that fires some kind of changes.
    Maybe split charges to projectile and hitscan is good idea.
    Game object that can shoot holds weapon and weapons slots (move out from
    general game object to more specific class). On fire? it fires current weapon
    (calls method from weapon object that spawns new charge).

* TODO Code live reload
  Use livesupport inside sdl2 loop.
